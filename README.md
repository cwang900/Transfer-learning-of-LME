# Transfer-learning-of-LME
Read Me: This document provides a comprehensive demonstration of the Algorithm 1 in the manuscript "Data-Level Transfer Learning for Degradation Modeling and Prognosis" from Journal of Quality Technology, authored by Amirhossein Fallahdizcheh and Chao Wang from University of Iowa. For the code clearness, we demonstrate the case for 'source is higher than the target', which covers all the steps in the Algorithm 1. We also include the two benchmarks, i.e., MGP and Non-transfer, in this code. Running this code 100 times can present the results similar to the Fig. 4 in the manuscript (subject to the randomness of data generation). The annotations along with the code can provide links to the steps or terminologies in the manuscript.
